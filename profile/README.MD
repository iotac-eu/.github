# IoTAC - EU Horizon 2020 
**IoTAC** (Security By Design IoT Development and Certificate Framework with Front-end Access Control) is an EU-funded H2020 research and innovation project comprising of 13 partners from 7 countries across industry, academia and the research fora.

IoTAC aims to deliver a novel, secure and privacy-friendly IoT architecture that will facilitate the development and operation of more resilient IoT service environments through 
1. monitoring and evaluation of applications security throughout the broader software development lifecycle; 
2. the introduction of an advanced access control mechanism based on new interactions and workflow using chip card and PKI technology; 
3. the runtime monitoring of the system as well as provisioning of security countermeasures that are implemented both at hardware- and at software-level and 
4. associated platforms which will provide security certification of the produced applications and system, based on international security standards, best practices and the research results of the project.

The results will be demonstrated with four IoT use case implementations â€“ automotive, airborne, smart home and smart industry.

IoTAC is funded under the EU Horizon 2020 programme.
